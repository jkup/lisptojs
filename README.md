# Lisp to JavaScript Compiler

A simple Lisp to JavaScript compiler implemented in TypeScript. This project provides a basic implementation of a compiler that can convert a subset of Lisp code into equivalent JavaScript code.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Variable definition: `(define var value)`
- Function definition: `(define (func-name args) body)`
- Function call: `(func-name args)`

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6.x or higher, usually bundled with Node.js)
